Swift 3.5 installation.
-------------------------

1) Copy the Swift installation to your disk.

2) Run the swift ('bin/swift console' on Linux, 'bin/swift.bat console' on Windows)

   Swift will give you an URL (e.g. http://server:8080). Open the URL in your web browser. The configuration page
      should appear.

   Several things can go wrong:

   a) You do not have Java installed
       Swift needs Java 1.6.0 or newer to run. Download Java from http://java.com

   b) the default port number 8080 is taken.
   		Specify a different port in conf/wrapper.conf configuration file.

3) Follow the instructions on the configuration page. Swift will produce a configuration file (swift.conf),
   	with all your specific settings. Swift will also give you instructions about how to start it.

4) Full Swift will start if conf/swift.conf is present. If you want to start on square one, delete this file and
        Swift will run in config-only mode again.
