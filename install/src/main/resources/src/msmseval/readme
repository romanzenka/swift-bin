msmsEval is an application designed to evaluate the quality of tandem mass
spectra from LCn/MS/MS type datasets. Probability values for the likelihood
for a "good" quality spectrum is assigned to each spectrum. Further,
msmsEval can export spectra as DTA files for all spectra with a specified
cut-off probability value.
