This folder contains .fasta files produced by Swift's database curator.

Just putting a fasta file in this folder does not mean Swift will see it. Use the database upload step instead.

A file in this folder can typically be re-created on demand, providing you keep around
the original fasta sources (in dbcurator/archive), the user-uploaded files (dbcurator/uploads)
and the Swift database. In practice deleting the contents of this folder is not recommended.
